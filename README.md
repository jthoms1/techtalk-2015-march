Open Source Development and Front End Testing



Process
* Earthling Interactive (EI) will contribute/maintain our open source projects under the Earthling Interactive organization on Github.
* The work that is billed to Earthling Interactive and contributed to Open Source should be managed on a case by case
  basis through an assigned team leader(s).
* New open source projects must be reviewed and team leader(s) assigned prior to significant development work taking place.
* We will contribute to the projects of other organizations that we actively use.
* Time spent on Open Source projects will be billed to Earthling Interactive.
 
Code Separation
* There should never be an issue with intellectual property being incorporated into these projects that might be deemed
  as property of our clients.
* At no point in time will code be copied from a project that was billed to a client to the Open Source project.
* We also will not bill client’s for work that is contributed to an open source project where that work will or may
  ultimately benefit the client.
* Our policy is to never incorporate ideas/code that is specific to a client’s domain expertise into the open source project.
